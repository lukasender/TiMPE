TiMPE - Transactions in Massively Parallel Environments
=======================================================

The project 'TiMPE' focuses on a 'user to user' transaction system which
was implemented as a prototype for the project `Validate Your Idea`_
(`VYI`_).

"[...] [VYI] serves as a showcase and demonstrates how one can develop an
application using the `eventually consistent` data base `Crate Data`_.
Crate Data does not provide a transaction system such as locking, but
offers what is called multi-version concurrency control (`MVCC`_).
Therefore, different techniques must be used to achieve data consistency.
Especially in modern applications where many simultaneous requests are
being made." Lukas Ender, May 2014 `VYI`_
